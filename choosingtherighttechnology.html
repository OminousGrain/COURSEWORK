        <h1>Choosing The Right Technology</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        The simple implementation of smart software is often the cure for issues that have been plaguing businesses for years. Be it implementing a new way to prioritise tasks collectively, or simply an app that lets employees know whose lunch break it is. Software can be employed to a nearby infinite range of problems. 
        However, the first step is knowing what problems your business has, and then you need to evaluate which of the plethora of existing software solutions is right for your business.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Before looking for a solution, spend some time brainstorming what issues your business has, it might be small things, like not being notified when a task has been completed, or something big, like not being able to digitally access certain files. Regardless, before you take this step you are unable to look for IT solutions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Evaluating Software Solution Criteria</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Project age and maturity </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        The level to which a piece of software is established demonstrates its reliability. If it is brand new, there is likely to be a lot of bugs. However, old software that hasn’t been maintained will likely be unable to handle unseen situations that appear over time. It also depends on how independent and simple a solution is, if a solution relies a lot on other frameworks, one should be careful using it. It likely doesn’t work as intended anymore.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        Look at the softwares reported vulnerabilities. Also, consider what you are using the software for and if it involves risking valuable assets. For example, image sharing might require a good standard of privacy assurance that some software might not provide; for example ‘hosting images on a public cloud server’.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        The usefulness of code is often determined by how usable it is. This involves having clear to read and understandable documentation. A piece of software can be amazing, but no-one will know it if you haven’t explained how to use it. Similarly to the ‘project age and maturity’, the documentation should be well maintained and updates. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Licensing</h3>
        <br>


        <p>
        Certain software might be free to use as an individual, but not for businesses. Similarly, software might be great for individual cases but can’t be used in combination with other software.  Keep in mind that GPL-licensed software is not compatible with the terms of the Apple App Store, so anything you use will need to be under another license.
