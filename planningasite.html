        When it comes to building a site, its easy to get overwhelmed. However, like with anything else in programming, breaking the process of building your site down into bitesize chunks helps make the whole process far less overwhelming
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Determine the site's functionality</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        The process of building your site has to begin with actually determining what you need your site to be able to do. This is known as the site’s functionality. If you know your site will need the ability to create shopping baskets or process transactions then the complexity of the site increases. Luckily for our example we need to only make a site that performs basic text-display functions with some simple navigation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Have some content ready before you start building the website</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Its very difficult to structure a site if you don’t know what you want to put on it. Before creating a site, its a good idea to have some content. Otherwise you wont know where to start. In our case, we know that we have to fulfil the brief provided which gives us a basic framework for a site, with each of the pages (hopefully) fulfilling the specified criteria.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Create a site map diagram</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        The process of visualising out your website can be a great help in creating the raw bones of your site. Sites like gloomaps.com can help ease the transition from vague idea to definite structure. Below is an example of a site map, based upon the coursework brief.

          <h2>Planning a Site using Trello</h2>
        <p>
        The process of planning a site can also be greatly aided by using productivity applications such as 'Trello'. The image below shows part of the process of planning this site.
