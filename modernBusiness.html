	    <p>In the modern world, IT is the foundation upon which all aspects of the business depend. From large-scale down to small businesses a good Information Technology architecture is essential to enable the institution to function and thrive. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Communications</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This can be subdivided into internal and external communications. Internal communications is how team-members communicate with each-other and coordinate. External communications might be clients phoning in with inquiries. It can range from telephone systems regulated by a logical topology ( implemented by computer software) to email systems. It can also include applications such as Trello, Discord, and IRC.</p>
         <br>
        <h2>Inventory</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The way in which a company keeps tracks of its resources should be up to date with the digital age. Assuming security concerns are weighed against convenience, the company should quickly be able to access and assess its inventory. Inventory could be physical stock, team workloads, and current tasks. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This is something that should be considered in parallel with security risk concerns. Although the ability to quickly access documents is convenient, it would be equally convenient for someone who should not have the permission to view those documents. However, a good IT solution should keep a balance between accessibility and security.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Information Management</h2>
         <br>
        <p>The ability to monitor the performance of a system such  as a website and to improve its performance is the concern which companies devote many thousands of dollars to. SEO optimisation is the process of tinkering with your site to improve its ranking on google; this would be considered using ‘information management’ to improve website performance. Similarly, click funnels are optimised to increase the rate of conversion into actual inquiries or purchases (depending on the service you are providing).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most importantly, your IT team knows the best and latest applications for performing all these operations, which turn directly into success and profitability for your company. Investing in proper training and recruiting is absolutely crucial for a business in today’s world.</p>
