        <h1>What is GDPR and How Does it affect your business?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        The internet has changed the ease of many routine tasks and advanced the speed of communication. We now do many of the things that used to be done in person over the internet. However, with this convenience also comes a risk to our privacy. To combat this, GDPR was enacted in May 2018 to change the way in which businesses are legally allowed to collect and store user data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, and applies across the whole EU and EEA.It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents. Personal data is any data that can be associated with an individual user; such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, names, usernames, etc.
        The 8 basic rights of GDPR
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Under the GDPR, individuals have:</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to access </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to be forgotten  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to data portability  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
        </p>
        <h2>The right to be informed  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to have information corrected </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to restrict processing  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to object </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The right to be notified  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
        </p>
        <p>
        GDPR applies to all businesses and organizations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. Even non-EU established organizations will be subject to GDPR. Therefore, if you are dealing with EU citizens you need to apply with GDPR.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>How do be GDPR compliant </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        The conditions for obtaining consent are stricter under GDPR. The individual must have the right to withdraw consent at any time and there is a presumption that consent will not be valid unless separate consents are obtained for different processing activities.
        </p>
        <p>
        This means you have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action, to receive a marketing email for example. It is not allowed to assume or add a disclaimer, and providing an opt-out option is not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
        GDPR has changed a lot of things for companies such as the way forms and data on visitors to the site are managed. Companies have had to review business processes, applications and forms to be compliant with double opt-in rules and email marketing best practices. In order to sign up for communication, prospects will have to fill out a form or tick a box and then confirm it was their actions in a further email.
