        <p>
        When engaged in a digital project there are often hurdles that impact project progression. Sometimes these are foreseeable, but other times they cannot be avoided. However, we are able to categorise common ‘Digital Project Hazards’ that a team might encounter.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Scope creep </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Uncontrolled changes and continuous growth of scope. This might be if you poorly define the outline of a website before offering to build it for a client. This could result in ‘scope creep’ as more and more features are demanded of you, while the budget for the project remains the same.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Estimates are inaccurate </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Inaccurate estimates is a common project risk. For example, a project might underestimate the feasibility of a feature, leading to the project falling behind  on its target milestones. Over time, depending on how strict the project budget is, this might cause a project to fail.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Too many decision makers</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        If you are trying to design a site, too many cooks can spoil the broth. This is especially the case if style decisions and conventions aren’t kept consistent. This can lead to delays in decision-finalisation, meaning falling behind on targets. Alternatively, it might result in a finished product that fails to satisfy the client. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Cross-platform compatibility </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Designing a site in 2019 means that we have to design our projects to be operable and have a pleasing user experience on multiple platforms and browsers. Smaller scale websites and digital projects often fail to provide functional alternatives for IOS and other mobile platforms
