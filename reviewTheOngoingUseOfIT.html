        <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
        <p>
        VS Code was useful for formatting the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code. The syntaxing tools, highlighting and auto-fill features enabled me to type code far more efficiently. Similarly, the file-system being visible helped me more easily organise my code and access files, like images, when required. This was due to me being able to see the relative file-path of each file within each folder on the same display. Similarly, the debugging feature was utilised extensively when looking for errors. 
        </p>




        <h2>Chrome Browser</h2>
        <p>
        The Chrome browser was used to launch and test my webpages, specifically it enabled me to check that the interconnectivity of the site was functional, that all the links went to where they were supposed to and all the pages displayed a uniform style. Chrome is a well-maintained browser so all of the latest features could be used in designing my website. 
        </p>




        <h2>Safari Browser </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        I tested my website also using  the Safari browser; conscious of the fact that cross-compatibility on different browsers.Through successfully running my website on multiple browsers I showed that my website was sustainable and suitable for visitors using various browsers.

        <h2>Trello</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Trello was invaluable for organising my tasks and objectives. It enabled me to keep a clear focus on what I was required to do next; orientated my tasks and facilitated problem solving in a clear framework
