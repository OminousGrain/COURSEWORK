<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
<p>
I am a hard-working individual, whose dedication to work is demonstrated by my impressive academic record. I have a very wide skill-set with grounding both in STEM and humanities. I have a strong ability to resolve problems, demonstrated by my ability to perform test-driven-development as a part of my journey to learn full-stack development. Each task was approached in a systematic fashion and slowly functionality was added to the programmes I was designing.
</p>
<p>
 I have a good ability to work in a team; this was shown in a programming bootcamp course I attended, where 'pair programming' was commonly used to improve efficiency. It would increase the speed of the programming process by allowing us to spot each other's simple mistakes and forcing us to vocalize and explain our process to each other, thereby improving our general understanding of the concepts we were applying to a problem. Similarly, I have a good understanding of general computer hardware.
