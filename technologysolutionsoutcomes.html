     <h2>Using Trello</h2>
    <p>
    Trello is an invaluable tool for planning large projects. In producing this coursework I utilised Trello extensively. It was utilised for monitoring the projects scope, for orienting tasks and for formatting basic versions of the site. Beginning with basic framework of the site, providing pages with the relevant content, up to providing a more stylised and presentable finished site. The public Trello used to plan this blog can be found <a href='https://trello.com/b/kUgdMpi1'><strong>here</strong></a>
    </p>
    <h2>Using GitHub</h2>
    <p>
    Github was used to provide access to the site files from multiple locations, allowing me to work on the project from multiple locations. Similarly, it allowed me to keep the project updated as new versions of the site were tested and then pushed to the master branch.
    </p>
    <h2>Using Visual Studio Code</h2>
    <p>
        Visual Studio Code was the source code editor used to create this blog. It dealt with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript sketching and debugging.
    </p>
    <h2>Using Word Processors</h2>
    <p>
        Word Online was used to write the text content for this blog, it was then converted into HTML appropriate syntax. It is possible to write entirely within the HTML framework, however, it is a much nicer user experience to use a word processor.
